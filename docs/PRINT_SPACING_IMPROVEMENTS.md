# Print Spacing Improvements

## Overview
I've enhanced the spacing between item names and costs when users print the shop display. The improvements provide better readability and a more professional appearance in printed documents.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Print Styles (`app/globals.css`)
Added new print-specific CSS classes:

- **`.print:item-spacing`** - Provides proper flex layout with improved spacing
- **`.print:item-name`** - Styles item names with right padding and flexible width
- **`.print:item-price`** - Styles prices with proper alignment and spacing
- **`.print:line-spacing`** - Improves line height and margin for better readability

### 2. Updated Shop Display Component (`components/shop-display.tsx`)
Modified the item list rendering to use the new print spacing classes:

- Added `print:item-spacing` and `print:line-spacing` classes to each item
- Applied `print:item-name` class to item names
- Applied `print:item-price` class to prices

### 3. Updated Print Function (`app/creator/page.tsx`)
Enhanced the inline print styles in the `handlePrint` function to include:

- Improved `li` styling with proper flexbox layout
- New print-specific classes for consistent spacing
- Better typography and alignment for printed output

## How It Works

### Before:
```
Item Name                    Price
Another Item                 Cost
```
Items were justified to opposite ends with minimal spacing control.

### After:
```
Item Name          15 GP
Another Item       25 SP
Very Long Item Name That Extends    100 GP
```
Items now have:
- Consistent baseline alignment
- Proper spacing between name and price
- Better handling of long item names
- Improved readability with enhanced line spacing

## Key Features

1. **Responsive Spacing**: Item names get appropriate padding, and prices are properly aligned
2. **Long Name Handling**: Long item names won't crowd the prices
3. **Consistent Typography**: Enhanced font weights and line spacing for print
4. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Works across different browsers and print engines
5. **Theme Consistency**: Spacing works with all existing shop themes

## Usage

The improvements are automatically applied when users click the "Print Shop" button. No additional configuration is needed - the enhanced spacing will be visible in:

- Print preview
- Actual printed documents
- PDF exports (when printing to PDF)

## Technical Details

The solution uses:
- CSS Flexbox for reliable cross-browser layout
- Print-specific media queries
- Tailwind CSS utility classes with print modifiers
- Inline styles in the print function for maximum compatibility

This ensures the spacing improvements work regardless of how the styles are loaded or cached.
